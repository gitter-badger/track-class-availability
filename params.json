The user can choose whether to be notified when a section opens or closes. Track Class Availability will then check all your classes via WebTMS every hour to see if the sections you are tracking open or close. If the classes you are tracking open or close, you will be notified of the status change via email.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have [Python installed.](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Then just click the \"Download as Zip\" above and [install BeautifulSoup before using!](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download). When those are installed, simple open a Terminal and cd into the directory. For example if my unzipped folder is in my downloads, I would open the Terminal and type `cd ~/Downloads/heinst-track-class-availability-7771aa3/` and then type `python python trackClassAvailability.py` and follow the setup process. If you want to add more classes, follow the exact format of line that program created for you in the file `ClassesToTrack.txt`. You can [run this on a cron job](http://www.thesitewizard.com/general/set-cron-job.shtml) so that way it will check every set interval for class status changes and email you.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with setup? Make an issue here or tweet me! @trevorheins and I will do my best to help you out and get you up and running.\r\n\r\nclass-tracker-availability made with &#10084; by @heinst","google":"UA-61614336-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
